Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Hello Jenkins
[Hello Jenkins] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/jenkins9832531463361122197.sh
+ mkdir -p /new
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/new’: Permission denied
Build step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure
Finished: FAILURE

Project Solutions:
1. Use a directory Jenkins can access
Instead of /new, use a path inside Jenkins' workspace or somewhere Jenkins has write access:

sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p $WORKSPACE/new
This is the most common fix and works in almost all scenarios.

2. Change directory permissions (not recommended unless you know what you're doing)
You could change permissions on / or use sudo, but that's risky and not recommended for Jenkins jobs:

Jenkins usually runs as a limited user (like jenkins) for security reasons.

Giving it root access opens you up to big security risks.
